# PVArr - Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Core Failover Engine & Studio Foundations
- [x] **Task 1: Environment, Project Structure & Dependency Setup**
- [x] **Task 2: Core Failover Engine (`stream-recorder.py` / `app/recorder.py`)**
- [x] **Task 3: Sports File-Naming & Storage Module (`app/naming.py`)**
- [x] **Task 4: Web Server Backend (`app/server.py`)**
- [x] **Task 5: Web Management Dashboard UI (`app/templates/index.html`)**
- [x] **Task 6: Application Runner Script (`start.sh`) & Graceful Process Cleanup**

## Phase 2: PVArr Branding, Direct FFmpeg Optimization & *Arr Ecosystem Integration
- [x] **Task 1: Recorder Optimization & Proxy Fallback Logic (`app/recorder.py`)**
- [x] **Task 2: *Arr-Style UI & Favicon Integration (`app/templates/index.html` & `app/static/favicon.svg`)**
- [x] **Task 3: Post-Processing Engine (`app/post_processor.py`)**
- [x] **Task 4: Media Server & Notification Webhooks (`app/notifications.py`)**
- [x] **Task 5: Virtual IPTV / M3U Tuner Endpoint (`app/tuner.py` & `app/server.py`)**
- [x] **Task 6: Dockerization & Deployment Assets (`Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml`)**

## Phase 3: Documentation, AI Transparency & GitHub Release
- [x] **Task 1: Production README.md & AI Transparency Disclosure**
  - Feature list, architecture overview, API reference, quick start guides (CLI + Docker)
  - "Finding Your Stream URL" guide (DevTools / `detect-headers` / `curl` verification)
  - AI transparency callout banner + dedicated `## AI Genesis & Environmental Footprint` section
  - Env var table, endpoints, and file references verified against the actual codebase

- [x] **Task 2: Git Prep & Publish Automation (`scripts/publish.sh`)**
  - `.gitignore` verified (excludes `venv/`, `__pycache__`, test recordings, logs, `.env`)
  - `scripts/publish.sh` stages, commits, and provides exact GitHub remote attach + push commands

## Phase 4: Release Hardening
- [x] **Task 1: `LICENSE`** — The Unlicense (public domain, no attribution required)

- [x] **Task 2: Automated test suite (`test_pvarr.py`)**
  - 58 tests, stdlib `unittest`, no new dependencies
  - Covers: filename sanitisation + path-traversal rejection, output-path
    collision handling, storage rename/delete guards, M3U + XMLTV generation,
    dependency resolution, failover candidate parsing, FFmpeg argv construction
  - Two end-to-end remux tests encode a real 1s transport stream; they skip
    automatically when FFmpeg is absent
  - CI: `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs the suite on Python 3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12

## Closed by decision (not open work)
- **Quantified AI footprint figures — will not add.** The build was never
  instrumented: no token counts, inference wall-clock, or energy draw were
  recorded while it happened, and providers do not publish per-token energy
  for frontier models. Any gram-of-CO₂e or litre-of-water figure produced
  now would be fabricated, which is exactly the failure mode a transparency
  section exists to avoid. The README instead states what is unknown and why,
  and notes that continuous 24/7 recording dominates the one-time build cost
  regardless. Reopen only if real provider usage data becomes available.

## Genuinely still open
- [ ] Integration tests for `app/server.py` routes (needs FastAPI `TestClient`)
- [ ] No test coverage for `recorder._recording_loop` failover transitions —
      the core logic is exercised only at the unit level, not end to end
